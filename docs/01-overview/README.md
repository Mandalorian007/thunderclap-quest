# Discord RPG Bot - Concept Document

## Core Vision
A lightweight RPG experience that lives entirely in Discord. Players engage through simple slash commands, receive immediate feedback with text and emojis, and progress through bite-sized encounters. Focus on trivial implementation, instant gratification, and future expandability.

## Design Principles
- **Player Agency**: Every encounter offers meaningful choices that feel impactful
- **Emergent Stories**: Choices create unique narrative moments and consequences  
- **Immediate Engagement**: Rich flavor text and contextual options hook attention
- **Replayability**: Variety in encounters and outcomes drives natural curiosity
- **Discord-Native**: Leverage Discord's UI patterns (buttons, embeds) for seamless experience

## Core Game Loop
