Systematically review the complete project documentation to understand Thunderclap Quest. Read these files in order:

1. README.md - Project overview
2. docs/01-game-context.md - Game design and mechanics
3. docs/02-developer-guide.md - Technical architecture
4. docs/03-roadmap.md - Current implementation status

After reading all documentation, provide a concise acknowledgment of the current project status and ask what I need assistance with.
