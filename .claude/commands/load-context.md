I need you to systematically review the complete project documentation to understand the Thunderclap Quest design. Please work through this in the following order:

## Step 1: Project Overview
First, read the main README.md to understand the high-level project vision and structure.

## Step 2: Review Documentation by Directory
Then systematically work through each documentation directory in order:

1. **docs/01-overview/** - Read all files to understand the core concept and technical architecture
2. **docs/02-game-design/** - Review all game mechanics, player systems, and combat design
3. **docs/03-technical/** - Study the implementation frameworks and technical patterns

## Instructions
- Use the Read tool to examine each file thoroughly
- For each directory, provide a brief summary of what you learned about that aspect of the project
- After completing all sections, provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's current design state
- Note any gaps, inconsistencies, or areas that might need clarification

Take your time to absorb the complete design vision so you can work effectively on implementation tasks.
