I need you to systematically review the complete project documentation to understand the Thunderclap Quest design. Please work through this in the following order:

## Step 1: Project Overview
First, read the main README.md to understand the high-level project vision and structure.

## Step 2: Essential Documentation
Then read the three essential documentation files that contain all core information:

1. **docs/01-game-context.md** - Complete game design, mechanics, and progression systems
2. **docs/02-developer-guide.md** - Technical implementation guide and architecture patterns
3. **docs/03-roadmap.md** - Development progress tracker and implementation priorities

## Instructions
- Use the Read tool to examine each file thoroughly
- For each document, provide a brief summary of what you learned about that aspect of the project
- After completing all documents, provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's current design state
- Note any gaps, inconsistencies, or areas that might need clarification

These three documents contain all the essential information needed to work effectively on implementation tasks.
