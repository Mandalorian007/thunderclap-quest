# Game Level Progression System Design

## Overview

The Game Level Progression System provides a global progression benchmark that increases automatically every two weeks while allowing for manual administrative adjustments. This creates a dynamic catch-up and prestige system that keeps content accessible for new players while rewarding dedicated players who progress beyond the current game level.

## Core Concepts

### Game Level vs Player Level
- **Game Level**: A global server value representing the current "content level" benchmark
- **Player Level**: Individual player progression based on accumulated XP
- **Automatic Progression**: Game level increases by +10 every two weeks via scheduled system
- **Manual Flexibility**: Administrators can adjust game level as needed without disrupting the automatic schedule

## Game Level Progression Schedule

### Bi-Weekly Increases
- **Frequency**: Every 14 days at midnight UTC
- **Increment**: +10 levels per increase
- **Consistency**: Automatic increases continue regardless of manual adjustments
- **Predictability**: Players can anticipate progression schedule

### Example Timeline
```
Week 0:  Game Level 10
Week 2:  Game Level 20  (+10 automatic)
Week 4:  Game Level 30  (+10 automatic)
Week 6:  Game Level 40  (+10 automatic)
Week 8:  Game Level 50  (+10 automatic)
```

### Manual Adjustments
- **Administrative Control**: Can set game level to any value at any time
- **Schedule Preservation**: Manual changes don't affect the bi-weekly automatic schedule
- **Flexibility**: Allows for balancing, events, or special circumstances

## Player Experience Impact

### XP Multiplier System

#### Catch-Up Mechanics (Below Game Level)
Players below the current game level receive XP bonuses to help them reach current content:

```
XP Multiplier = 1.0 + (levels_behind × bonus_per_level)
Maximum Bonus: 5.0x (500% XP)
```

**Example: Game Level 30**
- Player Level 20: 2.5x XP (250% rate)
- Player Level 25: 1.5x XP (150% rate)
- Player Level 29: 1.1x XP (110% rate)

#### Prestige Penalties (Above Game Level)
Players above the current game level face reduced XP to maintain challenge:

```
XP Multiplier = 1.0 - (levels_ahead × penalty_per_level)
Minimum Rate: 0.1x (10% XP)
```

**Example: Game Level 30**
- Player Level 35: 0.7x XP (70% rate)
- Player Level 40: 0.4x XP (40% rate)
- Player Level 50: 0.1x XP (10% rate)

## Player Benefits by Type

## Balancing Philosophy

### Progression Rate Guidelines
- **Base XP per Encounter**: 10-30 XP depending on engagement level
- **Daily Play Target**: 100-200 base XP (3-6 encounters)
- **Weekly Progression**: 1-2 levels at game level with regular play
- **Catch-Up Effectiveness**: 2-3 weeks to reach game level from significantly behind

### Level Increase Rationale

- **Catch-Up Window**: Creates ongoing opportunity for new players to reach relevance
- **Prestige Zone**: Maintains challenge for players who push ahead

## Administrative Features
